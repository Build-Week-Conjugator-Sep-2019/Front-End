   Practice your language skills (conjugations)


- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
  Helps people learn how to improve their language skills


- What is the mission statement?
  We will improve your spanish-speaking skills
  
## Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Landing page
Standard login/registration
Dashboard containing user’s information of lifetime conjugations completed
The actual conjugation to complete
Backend with appropriate routes
Implementing difficulty levels based on past, present, future
Styling according to difficulty (we’ll discuss color combinations soon)

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
	N/A

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
	Duolingo - Keeps track of progress, conjugations, pictures that matches words, etc.

No
## Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific. 
People who are interested in learning a second language (Spanish)
Those that are traveling to a spanish-speaking country
Communicate with other spanish speakers in your location
   

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
N/A



- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
N/A

## Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
